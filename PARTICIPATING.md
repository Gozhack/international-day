# A set of ideas to help chapters plan their events for [international day](http://nodeschool.io/international-day/)

## Rollcall
In order for you attendees to appear on the international rollcall, each chapter must add its attendees to the [international-day team](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/international-day).  We will use the github api to render an attendee rollcall on the website.

## Hangout
- Pick a chapter far away from you on the globe and set up a time to do a google hangout during the day (like [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/14) or [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/13))
- Take a group photo!
- If there is anyone in your community with sound/audio/video expertise, ask them to come and interview attendees. Upload your video to youtube afterwards and share it with the nodeschool/organizers repository so we can include it in a NodeSchool International Day short film.
