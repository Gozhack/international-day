# Requirements

The participation of each chapter is voluntary, no person has to attend the international day. However when you do there are a few things that you should follow to make it a enjoyable experience (and a day to remember).
- The person that enrolled the chapter (owner) becomes responsible to uphold  [the code of conduct](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/blob/2015/code_of_conduct_en.md) and as such has to leave his/her contact information for the duration of the event and up to two weeks after that.
- The owner - or a mentor that can take over the responsibility - has to be at the event for the whole specified duration in the event page.
- During the time you specified in the event site the owner should be reachable using the given skype account (given during enrollment)
- If the major language in your country is not english you have to translate the code of conduct and other imporant information to this language.
- Add your logo to the [hexdex](http://nodeschool.io/hexdex.html) so its easier for us to make a nice site

## Rollcall
In order for you attendees to appear on the international rollcall, each chapter must add its attendees to the [international-day team](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/international-day).  We will use the github api to render an attendee rollcall on the website.

## Data Collection
It would be awesome if you could fill out this: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Pg8QS09IggOsH8etXK7zDUqglobHBFD0OJvP5za2MwU/viewform

## Hangout
- Pick a chapter far away from you on the globe and set up a time to do a google hangout during the day (like [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/14) or [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/13))
- Take a group photo!
- If there is anyone in your community with sound/audio/video expertise, ask them to come and interview attendees. Upload your video to youtube afterwards and share it with the nodeschool/organizers repository so we can include it in a NodeSchool International Day short film.

How to make a hangout:

1. You introduce the other chapter quickly
2. The chapter owner talks short (<=5min) about what they will do at their chapter
3. The chapter takes you on the main screen, so everybody at his chapter sees you
4. He introduces you to his chapter
5. The chapter owner takes the camera to show the venue and everybody from the other chapter say together “HI!”
6. You take the camera through our venue and everybody from your chapter say together “HI!"
7. Then I take it off the main screen
8. (ONLY If the other chapter also has presentation screen with speakers!) You talk 5 minutes about your chapter

## Minifilm
In order to be a part of the mini film, you must take a group photo with your chapter, or record a short "Hello from [you chapter name]" and commit it to [Video](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/tree/2015/Video)

Please try to get videos showing:

- Establishing shot of the venue from outside of the building
- A few shots inside of people mingling and talking
- Some shots walking around the room using the Hyperlapse app if possible
- Group shot of everyone shouting "Hello from xxx" in english.
- Group shot of everyone shouting "We love Nodeschool" in their native language
- Panning shots of the room with everyone on laptops

Optionally it would be nice to have:
- Talking heads style shots of the attendees as they arrive saying what they are hoping to get out of the event.
- Talking heads style shots of the attendees at the end saying what they thought of the event.
- Shots over people leaving at the end


## Social Media
Encourage your attendees to tweet, post pictures and small videos to Instagram with the hashtag #nodeschool.

## PAST ITEMS

### Enrollment
- Enroll with your chapter in [issue#8](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/8)
- Create an event sign-up page by May 1st using any given event site (for example: [Ti.to](https://ti.to/), [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/), [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), [Connpass](http://connpass.com/) or  [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/)) or on your own site and [tell us about it](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/22)
- The event site **has to** have a location that tells people how to access it, a time to start and end. If you have limited space (usually the case) you have to write that down and make sure that its known beforehand. The event does not need to be free but may not exceed a price of 10usd and may not discriminate against anyone.

Note: After enrollment the owner will be added to the [international-day-group ](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/international-day). This is to makes sure that we are able to notify you through github if needed (check your github notifications)

### Stickers
The [stickers](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/tree/2015/Stickers) have been prepared and are ready to send to you printer. Enjoy! (PS.: You can also order it internationally [at hexi.pics]( https://hexi.pics/items/aa621a0d29b88cab04f188aeb98788a9))
