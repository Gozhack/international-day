# Requirements

The participation of each chapter is voluntary, no person has to attend the international day. However when you do there are a few things that you should follow to make it a enjoyable experience (and a day to remember).

- Enroll with your chapter in [issue#8](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/8)
- Create an event sign-up page by May 1st using any given event site (for example: [Ti.to](https://ti.to/), [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/), [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), [Connpass](http://connpass.com/) or  [Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp/)) or on your own site and [tell us about it](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/22)
- The event site **has to** have a location that tells people how to access it, a time to start and end. If you have limited space (usually the case) you have to write that down and make sure that its known beforehand. The event does not need to be free but may not exceed a price of 10usd and may not discriminate against anyone.
- The person that enrolled the chapter (owner) becomes responsible to uphold  [the code of conduct](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/blob/2015/code_of_conduct_en.md) and as such has to leave his/her contact information for the duration of the event and up to two weeks after that.
- The owner - or a mentor that can take over the responsibility - has to be at the event for the whole specified duration in the event page.
- During the time you specified in the event site the owner should be reachable using the given skype account (given during enrollment)
- If the major language in your country is not english you have to translate the code of conduct and other imporant information to this language.

Note: After enrollment the owner will be added to the [international-day-group ](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/international-day). This is to makes sure that we are able to notify you through github if needed (check your github notifications)

# Suggestions

Also we have set of ideas to help chapters plan their events for [international day](http://nodeschool.io/international-day/)

## Rollcall
In order for you attendees to appear on the international rollcall, each chapter must add its attendees to the [international-day team](https://github.com/orgs/nodeschool/teams/international-day).  We will use the github api to render an attendee rollcall on the website.

## Hangout
- Pick a chapter far away from you on the globe and set up a time to do a google hangout during the day (like [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/14) or [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/13))
- Take a group photo!
- If there is anyone in your community with sound/audio/video expertise, ask them to come and interview attendees. Upload your video to youtube afterwards and share it with the nodeschool/organizers repository so we can include it in a NodeSchool International Day short film.

## Stickers
The [stickers](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/tree/2015/Stickers) have been prepared and are ready to send to you printer.  Enjoy!

## Minifilm
In order to be a part of the mini film, you must take a group photo with your chapter, or record a short "Hello from [you chapter name]" and commit it to [Video](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/tree/2015/Video)
