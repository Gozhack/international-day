A set of ideas to help chapters plan their events for [international day](http://nodeschool.io/international-day/)

- Pick a chapter far away from you on the globe and set up a time to do a google hangout during the day (like [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/14) or [this](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/13))
- Take a group photo!
- If there is anyone in your community with sound/audio/video expertise, ask them to come and interview attendees. Upload your video to youtube afterwards and share it with the nodeschool/organizers repository so we can include it in a NodeSchool International Day short film.

Suggest more ideas to include on this list in [this thread](https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/12)
